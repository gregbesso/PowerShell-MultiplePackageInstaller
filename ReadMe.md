## Synopsis

The purpose of this PowerShell-MultiplePackageInstaller.ps1 script is to enable an admin to assign a silent install multiple 
software install packages to a chosen computer that is a part of an existing PSMANAGE scripting tool environment. 

For more information about the PSMANAGE scripts, check out: https://gregbesso.wordpress.com/projects/psmanage/
For more information about the LaunchPad script, check out: https://gregbesso.wordpress.com/projects/powershell-launchpad-script/

The script reads from the PSMANAGE SharePoint lists to gather information about available software installation packages, and 
also to get a list of computers that tasks can be assigned to. The admin picks a computer, picks one or more software install 
packages, and then clicks a button and tasks are created.

Then on their own interval, the computer checks in to get its tasks and then perform each one. Once the tasks are performed, 
the computer will update its tasks with details of the results. That is part of another script set, the PSMANAGE scripts.


## Code Example

The LaunchPad lets the admin select this scripting tool from their list of tools, if being used. Otherwise the admin can run this 
script directly.


## Motivation

I wanted to have a better way of deploying silent install packages to computers. In larger deployments, not all computers were online 
at the same time and I didn't want to have to go follow up / look for when they were back online. I wanted to build my own "home rolled" 
SMS / SCCM solution that tapped into the PSMANAGE scripting tool that I already had in place. The information was there, the phoning 
home was there, so I figured it would be easy to add this useful functionality.

This specific script is useful when you reimage a computer and are ready to roll it out to a user, but need all the software that is 
not on the image deployed first.



## Installation

This PowerShell-MassInstallPackage.ps1 file is meant to be run using the LaunchPad parent script, but can also be run stand-alone.
There is a required step, even after you have the PSMANAGE scripts up and running. The steps you should follow...

1) Get your PSMANAGE scripts installed and running. Without that, this won't work.
2) In the PSMANAGE-CentralServer-Imports.ps1 file, go to the Get-PSManageCentralServerStarted() function and uncomment 
the New-PSManageListsPackagesTasks line.
3) Wait for your server to run on the next scheduled time for your job, or run it manually.
4) You then need to access your new empty PSMANAGE-Packages list and enter one or more silent install packages into the list.
5) Then at that point you can use this script to create new tasks!
6) PS you can also just directly create tasks in your new empty PSMANAGE-Tasks list too, but this script makes it much easier 
to make tasks for many computers seamlessly.
